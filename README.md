# Zepto 2

A fantasy console like the Pico 8, but based around the restrictions of the original GameBoy. With the addition of a keyboard and mouse, that is. This is still a work in progress, so I may eventually add a mode that can work *entirely* with the input and output restrictions of the GameBoy.

# Breakdown

This is a breakdown of the source files, describing what happens in each.

* GBEngine.hx is the code to run the games. It stores the code, images, sounds, and maps. If you want to distribute the game without the editor, this file has all the required code for that.
* GBCode.hx is the code editor
* GBPixl.hx is the image editor (TODO)
* GBBeep.hx is the sound fx editor (TODO)
* GBTune.hx is the music editor (TODO)
* GBTile.hx is the map editor (TODO)
